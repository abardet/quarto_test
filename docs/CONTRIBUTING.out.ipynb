    "\n",
    "#### Before Submitting a Bug Report\n",
    "\n",
    "A good bug report shouldn‚Äôt leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n",
    "-   Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g.¬†using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the \\[documentation\\]. If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).\n",
    "-   To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).\n",
    "-   Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.\n",
    "-   Collect information about the bug:\n",
    "-   Stack trace (Traceback)\n",
    "-   OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)\n",
    "-   Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.\n",
    "-   Possibly your input and the output\n",
    "-   Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?\n",
    "\n",
    "We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Open an \\[Issue\\]. (Since we can‚Äôt be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)\n",
    "-   Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.\n",
    "-   Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.\n",
    "-   Provide the information you collected in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it‚Äôs filed: your issue will be flagged as \\[feature request\\] first, and if we agree on it, we will label it as \\[feature\\],meaning it has been accepted and the feature will eventually be added to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggesting Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for CONTRIBUTING.md, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before Submitting an Enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n",
    "-   Read the \\[documentation\\] carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.\n",
    "-   Perform a \\[search\\] to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n",
    "-   Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It‚Äôs up to you to make a strong case to convince the project‚Äôs developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you‚Äôre just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancement suggestions are tracked as \\[Gitlab issues\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.\n",
    "-   Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.\n",
    "-   **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.\n",
    "-   You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.\n",
    "-   **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most CONTRIBUTING.md users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.\n",

    "#### Pull Request Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few rules to follow in order to make code reviews and discussions go more smoothly before maintainers accept and merge your work:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   you MUST run the test suite\n",
    "-   you MUST write (or update) unit tests\n",
    "-   you SHOULD write documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Please, write [commit messages that make sense](#commit-messages), and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) before submitting your Pull Request.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be asked to [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) too. This is to ‚Äúclean‚Äù your Pull Request before merging it (we don‚Äôt want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitLab, you MUST write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further information about creating a Pull Request, please read [this blog post](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/11/20/on-creating-pull-requests/).\n",
